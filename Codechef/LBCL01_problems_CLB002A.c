/* Printing a number
In the last problem we saw how to print a number. Now it's your turn to print another number.

Your task is to print the number 20 on the screen.

In the editor, I have written some code for you. But instead of number 20, __ (underscores) are written.

Delete those underscores and write 20 at that place to complete the code. */
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    // Delete _ (underscore) and add 20 at it's place 
    printf("%d", 20);
    return 0;
}
